<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO JULIANA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time </h2>



<hr />


<h3>1 - Forrest Gump</h3>
<p> Tom Hanks is just amazing interpretating the main character. Its a Romance/Comedy. It encourages never to stop and cry over the past experiences.  </p>

<h3>2- Fast and Furious - Tokyo Drift </h3>
<p>Honestly, I don't know if it's a good movie or not, but I love it. 
I love car,races and drifts, so this makes this movie one of my favorites. </p>

<h3>3 - Mamma Mia! </h3>
<p>It's a musical movie, I have an emotional connection as I used to watch it with my aunt.  </p>
