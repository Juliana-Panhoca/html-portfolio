<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello World! <br />
  My name is Juliana Panhoca, I'm 28 years old, Brazilian living in the Netherlands it's being 6 years. 
  I have moved to NL because of my husband, as the company he was working for transfered him to here. </p>

<p>When in Brazil, I have studied Bachelor in Social Communication, which is my passion, I love to be in contact with people,
  understand their needing and do my best to solve all the issues and make them happy in the best possible way. </p>

<p>After moved to NL I could not find a job in my graduation area, so I've started to work with Supply Chain in an International Logistic company. 
  After 5 years working in the company and a burnout, I decided that it's time for a new chapter in my life. Time to go back to studies and try something new. 
This is how I endeed up here, creating my own Website. Yes! I'm learning Web Development! 
I know its a long journey ahead, but I'm prepared for this! Wish me lucky folks. </p>

<p>
  With love and enthusiasm, <br />
  Juliana Panhoca :D
